# Amazons
Game of 'Amazons' coded in Java. Invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas of Argentina, and originally called El Juego de las Amazonas (now a trademark of Ediciones de Mente). 
The board is a 10 by 10 chessboard. Each player gets four "amazons" (represented as chess queens), white for the player who moves first, and black for the opponent.
